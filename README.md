The use of mobile banking has not been efficiently utilized by bank customers and this has resulted in over crowded banking halls, risking exposure to COVID-19. 
The low usage can be traced to:
Complexity of the banking application.
Limited access to banking resources (e.g. ATM cards)
Poor UI/UX

Team Techwiz is looking to increase the percentage of users who would engage in online banking activities as opposed to on-premises banking with the dataset provided by zindi.ai.

This will help improve SDG goal 1, 2, 3,4,7, because when people have access to banking facilities at all times, they invest and make wise financial decisions
